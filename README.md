## Linear Regression to Predict

The purpose linear model that I designed is to predict the mpg of a vehicle by using it's weight, length, spoiler angle, ground clearance and AWD. The vehicle length and ground clearance produced a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because some of the independent variables had large effects on the dependent variable. The R value of the model is .7149 which indicates that it is a strong model for predicting the mpg value.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

When looking at the total summary of the current manufacturing data it does meet the design specification. The variance of this is set is 62.29 PSI which is below the 100 threshold.

When taking a look at the lots individually all meet the design speficiation except for lot 3 which has roughly a 170 PSI variance.
